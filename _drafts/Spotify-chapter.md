I have been remiss in blogging due to a major work/life update: I am now working on the Marketing Analytics team at Spotify!

It has been a crazy few months finishing up at Casper and transitioning to an exciting new role at Spotify. I am now working as a Data Analyst for Artist Marketing and Original Content at Spotify. In my fourth week in, I have already learned more than I could have imagined and I am confident there is plenty more to come.
