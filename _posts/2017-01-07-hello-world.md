My name is Margot and this is my blog!

### First things first: a quick intro...

I'm a native New Yorker and have always had an itch to travel. After studying abroad in Spain for a year of high school, I decided to study at St Andrews in Scotland where I studied International Relations and Arabic. While I absolutely loved both subjects, it felt like I got really good *asking* questions about how the world works, but I wanted to answer some of those questions in a more quantitative way. I moved to Bozeman, Montana [because it's insanely beautiful](http://www.visitmt.com/) and I also grew up spending time out there, worked there every summer I was at St Andrews, and NYC is *not* a place for a recent grad making a career change (#stress). While I was in Montana, I started taking math and statistics classes and eventually took a course in Economics, which felt like the perfect mix of asking and answering some of those bigger questions. I liked it so much that I went on to study my MSc in Economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in Stockholm ([also beautiful](https://www.visitstockholm.com/)).

Throughout my MSc in Economics I delved into all sorts of questions and had a particular interest in economic development, gender economics, and health, the pinnacle of which was my thesis on how rainfall shocks affected child health by age and gender in rural Ethiopia. I could talk about my research for days, but one of the biggest blessings/curses was that my co-author and I had to learn how to transform rainfall data using R and GIS in a matter of weeks. It was enormously stressful at the time but I loved it and it sparked my technical interest in data analysis and learning more about Data Science.

I am currently applying the econ background and building on the coding skills that I developed over the last two years as a Data Analyst at [Casper](https://casper.com/) here in NYC. So far I've been working in Python, SQL, and Looker to provide insights across the company and loving it. I'm excited to level up my technical skills both at Casper and constantly learning on the side, hence this blog.

### I wanted to create a blog for a few reasons. I'm excited to...

* **Challenge myself to develop more technical skills**

	As a relative noob to GitHub and total noob to html and css, not gonna lie it was a challenge setting up the website (more on that to come) but definitely worth it. I not only wanted to nail down my GitHub flow and dip my toes into new coding languages, but now I have a venue for cool projects to come using Python etc. 

* **Explore projects outside of work**

	One of the pieces of advice I got when I was transitioning from academia to Data Analytics was to "use public data in public." I ended up getting a job before I truly took the advice to heart, but the concept still holds - a blog is a great way to showcase technical skills and interests outside a couple of lines on a resume and to level up while doing so.

* **Share knowledge and hope that it's useful!**

	It's amazing to see how much code and knowledge is shared with tiny hints on stackoverflow sometimes leading to eureka moments. I'd like to continue in the same spirit of sharing insights and hope you enjoy!
