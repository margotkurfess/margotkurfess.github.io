### Hi! And welcome to my blog.

I'm a native New Yorker working in Data Analytics at [Casper](https://casper.com/) with a background in Economics (MSc). My goal is to explore more areas of Data Science and share projects and resources through this blog.

When I'm not digging into the data behind the wonderful world of sleep at work and blogging, a few things I enjoy are: 

* spending as much time as possible in the mountains (hiking, skiing, camping) and playing ice hockey
* starting book clubs with friends
* elevating underrepresented communities in tech

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate (esp. relating to that last point) so please feel free to reach out!
