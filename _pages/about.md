### Hi! And welcome to my blog.

I'm a native New Yorker working in Marketing Analytics at [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/margotkurfess). Previous to that, I worked in Marketing Analytics at [Casper](https://casper.com/) and have a background in Economics (MSc). My goal is to explore more areas of Data Science and share projects and resources through this blog.

When I'm not digging into the data behind Artist Marketing & Original Content at Spotify and blogging, a few things I enjoy are: 

* spending as much time as possible in the mountains (hiking, skiing, camping)
* playing ice hockey
* starting book clubs with friends

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate so please feel free to reach out!
