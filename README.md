Hello hello!

This is my first crack at building a website using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. 

My main goals are to:

* get the hang of the GitHub workflow
* dip my toes into other programming languages
* have a venue to share any interesting data projects, etc.

I forked the original template for this site from [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and the documentation can be found [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
